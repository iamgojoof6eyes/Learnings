- Download [sfml](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/) according to your ide and build version and your device
- Extract the downloaded file and setup it's path in your ide.
- Now compile the `main.cpp` file

  Still don't know how to perform this tasks??
  Don't worry I got you covered bud (not me exactly) you can take help from youtube or chat gpt (I know you are pro in using them so go for it)

  NOTE: Don't contact me if you are facing issue while compilation (I have struggled while compiling it so you too have to strugle) 🥸
